# Scan_Card
Demo project for sharing contacts by QR code and text recognition

## 1. Objective
This is my first commercial project required by software development company. The main purpose was
to design and implement a demo application on Android to gain more experience and knowledge. This application focuses on
exchanging of personal information such as names, emails, telephone numbers, etc. Instead of typing manually and saving
the data in Contacts, people can save their time by scanning generated QR codes or simple business cards.

## 2. Description
Project is mostly just a raw version for demonstration. It does not satisfy business needs in full manner. Some parts are
needed to be completed for successful distribution. Nevertheless, it greatly shows the potential of innovative technologies
like text recognition and QR codes.

Limitations are:
* it scans only definite types of business (namely 2 samples). This problem is that it cannot differentiate well the names
of people and companies. To solve following issue, application of ML might be useful. Text recognition algorithm is a
beta version itself, so, it sometimes makes mistakes and requires cranky conditions for photo quality. It is a real challenge
to enhance performance of text recognition algorithm.
* some UX functions does not work, i.e. adding avatar image, making calls, sending SMS, contacts synchronization, changing
theme, settings and so on. The code was omitted because these functions are not hard to implement and demo version
does not required it.
* NFC method was not implemented (also was not required)

Notwithstanding these issues, application is still useful in terms of idea and it's potential. Below is description of
functions with screenshots attached.

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 User Interface
UI design was made by designer who sent me icons and pictures, for which I coded XML. For some parts like floating button
additional APIs were used.

Example of look-and-feel:

### 3.2 Functions

#### 3.2.1 Share Your and Your Contacts' Info

##### 3.2.1.1 QR code
First of all, user of application must insert personal data, he/she wishes to share with other people. Required fields are
main telephone number (primary key) and full name. Other fields are optional and you can add them anytime later. 

![Filling Data](https://github.com/mikyegresl/Scan_Card/blob/master/img/ui_0.jpg)

In order
to share your personal data, QR code is generated including fields you filled earlier. To do so, open a menu and press
share image button. Bottom submenu will popup. Then press QR code.

#### 3.2.2 Scan QR codes
To scan QR code generated by application, tap on add button on page with contacts and choose *Scan QR*. You need to give
access to camera permission first.

Below is the info of another user.

![Data to Scan](https://github.com/mikyegresl/Scan_Card/blob/master/img/scan_qr_0.png)

This user wants to share data through QR code.

User generates QR code and now you can scan it. New window will open with form to add contact 
and fields will be filled automatically. You can edit/modify any fields.

After pressing on Save, a new contact will be added to contact list.

#### 3.2.3 Scan Business Cards
Another way to save time adding new contact is scanning a business card. Character recognition is used to detect blocks
of text and then filters applied to separate names, phone numbers, emails, websites, etc. These filters are just regular
expressions. In case of successul scan, TR returns whole text that was detected. It can be separated by lines and even
words!

If camera permissions were not given, allow it to scan through camera. Choose *Scan Card* method and take a shot of a 
card. Here is how it would look like:

![Scan Card](https://github.com/mikyegresl/Scan_Card/blob/master/img/scan_card_1.jpg)

In case of success, the result will be the same as in QR Scan method.

Again, if card did not contain much information, you are free to add/modify it.

#### 3.2.4 Type Manually
Manual method is just typing all information by your fingers. There is nothing special about it.

### 3.3 Local Database
To store contacts, cloud database is not required. There is no need in registration/login processes. Anything that is 
necessary is just local database like SQLite. You can see DAO and entities in Database folder inside the project.

## 4. APIs Used
1) Text recognition - 'com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-vision:19.0.2'
2) QR codes - 'com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:3.6.0'
3) For UI see gradle script
